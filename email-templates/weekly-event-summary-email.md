Hi everyone,

This Wednesday, we're having our regularly scheduled project night! Project nights are our weekly hacker/social hours for catching up on personal projects, reading, or anything remotely of that nature. It's like going to Starbucks, but with free refills and a bunch of other smart people just like yourself to ask questions to.

**Everyone** is welcome. You're welcome if you haven't written "hello world" yet, and you're just as welcome if you're a core contributor to the Python language.

If you haven't yet, RSVP here: *Remember to put the link in the email before you send it out! :)*

If you've got a pet project, great! Comment on the event and see if you can get someone to collaborate with you!

See you soon!
- *Your name here*

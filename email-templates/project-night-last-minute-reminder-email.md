Hey everyone,

Just a reminder that Project Night is tomorrow! There is still plenty of time to RSVP: *Your email here*

Don't know what project night is? It's a regular event to work on a personal project, whether that's coding or reading or anything else, in a group of other Python programmers. Think of it like going to Starbucks or the library, but you can ask other folks for help. 

Don't know if you know enough to contribute? You do! Project nights are for everyone who's doing something related to programming. Your experience doesn't matter; you're welcome regardless of what you know!

Now that I've gotten rid of your excuses for not showing up, I want to see you all there!

See you tomorrow!
- *Your name here :*
